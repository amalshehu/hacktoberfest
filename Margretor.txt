Hi, my name is Mihalache Octavian, I love open-source because 
software can evolve to be better and more advanced. Also 
open-source brings up communities together in a wonderful environment.
The idea that anybody can contribute to a project is simply stunning.
Imagine that someone has a great idea maybe the next iteration of
Linux, and you can help him building the next-gen OS or project.
To sum it up, open-source is a great thing to help us evolve.
