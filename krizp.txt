Aside from the obvious fact that it's free, I love open source because you get the chance to work
in a motivated and supporting community. It's also great to learn alot of new stuff from people all around the world. On top of it all, contributing to the open source community is greatly appreciated by everyone and can help you build a name for yourself.
